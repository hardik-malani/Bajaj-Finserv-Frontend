## ðŸš€ Project Overview

A client-side React application showcasing:

- *Autocomplete Search*: Real-time name suggestions (top 3).

- *Debounced Input* to limit re-renders during typing.
- *Bundle Splitting* and *Lazy Loading* for faster initial loads.
- *Mobile-first Design: Adaptive layout across **sm, **md, **lg* breakpoints.
- Achieves high Lighthouse scores (Performance â‰¥ 90, Accessibility â‰¥ 90).
